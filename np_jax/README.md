# Usage

## Obtaining MAP estimate and ground truth samples

Run `get_quantitities.py`.

An example command is as follows
```
python get_quantities.py -F logs with model=banana save_figures=True
```
where `logs` is the directory to save logs and other generated quantities.

The other options can be found in function `def my_config()` in file `get_quantities.py`. We describe the available options as follows
1. `model`: which model to run,
2. `standardized`: only apply to logistic regression experiments, whether to apply standardization
4. `save_figures`: whether to save figures (figures are saved to `np_jax/figs` directory),
5. `show_progress`: whether to show Stan sampling progress, if using Stan to obtain the samples.

The results contain 3 values, 
1. the found MAP estimate `MAP`, 
2. Stan diagnose, if the ground truth samples are generated using Stan `diagnose`, 
3. in case of using Stan to generate the samples, whether "Processing complete, no problems detected." is found inside Stan diagnose `no_problems`, i.e. whether Stan diagnoses conclude that there are no problems when generating the samples; in case of analytical samples, it is always `True`.

## Obtaining LA samples

Run `samples.py`.

An example command is as follows
```
python samples.py -F logs with model=banana save_figures=True
```
where `logs` is the directory to save logs and other generated quantities.

The other options can be found in function `def my_config()` in file `samples.py`. We describe the available options as follows
1. `model`: which model to run,
2. `num_samples`: how many samples to obtain,
3. `euclidean`: whether to run ELA,
4. `bergamin`: whether to run RLA-B,
5. `monge`: whether to run RLA-BLog,
6. `fisher`: whether to run RLA-F,
7. `empirical_fisher`: whether to run RLA-F with Empirical Fisher in place of Fisher,
8. `save_figures`: whether to save figures,
9. `save_samples`: whether to save samples,
10. `use_diffrax`: if True, use Diffrax for integration; else use SciPy for integration,
11. `standardized`: only apply to logistic regression experiments, whether to apply standardization,
13. `run_hessian_precision`: whether to run Laplace variant with negative Hessian as precision,
14. `run_fisher_precision`: whether to run Laplace variant with Fisher as precision,
15. `calc_metric`: whether to calculate Wasserstein distance to the ground truth samples.

> Note: under some circumstances the function `plot_marginal` is called for generating the plot. For ease of implementation, in `plot_marginal`, only the samples that fall inside the respective plotting limits are taken into account when generating the normalized histograms.

## Generating plots

For generating the plots of different methods on different models, see the previous descriptions.

### Figure 1

Run `get_geodesic_plots.py`.

> Note: requires at least having run `get_quantities.py` for model `banana_hausdorff`

An example command is as follows
```
python get_geodesic_plots.py -F logs
```
where `logs` is the directory to save logs and other generated quantities.

The other options can be found in function `def my_config()` in file `get_geodesic_plots.py`. We describe the available options as follows
1. `num_samples`: how many samples to obtain,
2. `calc_metric`: whether to calculate Wasserstein distance to the ground truth samples (require having run `get_quantities.py` for model `banana_hausdorff`),
3. `seed`: random seed for generating samples

### Figure 3

Run `bias_dim.py`.

An example command is as follows
```
python bias_dim.py -F logs
```
where `logs` is the directory to save logs and other generated quantities.

The other options can be found in function `def my_config()` in file `bias_dim.py`. We describe the available options as follows
1. `euclidean`: whether to run ELA,
2. `bergamin`: whether to run RLA-B,
3. `repeats`: number of independent runs to repeat

### First subplot of Figure 5

Run `get_banana_plots.py`.

> Note: requires at least having run `get_quantities.py` for model `banana_hausdorff`

An example command is as follows
```
python get_banana_plots.py -F logs
```
where `logs` is the directory to save logs and other generated quantities.

## Benchmark running time

Run `benchmark_time.py`.

> Note: requires having run `get_quantities.py` for the respective model

An example command is as follows
```
python benchmark_time.py -F logs with model=lr_ripley
```
where `logs` is the directory to save logs and other generated quantities.

The other options can be found in function `def my_config()` in file `benchmark_time.py`. We describe the available options as follows
1. `model`: which model to run,
2. `num_samples`: how many samples to obtain,
3. `bergamin`: whether to run RLA-B,
4. `monge`: whether to run RLA-BLog,
5. `fisher`: whether to run RLA-F,
6. `standardized`: only apply to logistic regression experiments, whether to apply standardization,
7. `run_hessian_precision`: whether to run LA variant with negative Hessian as precision,
8. `run_fisher_precision`: whether to run LA variant with Fisher as precision,
9. `calc_metric`: whether to calculate Wasserstein distance to the ground truth samples,
10. `save_samples`: whether to save the obtained samples,
11. `save_times`: whether to save the running times.

# Minor notes
1. We used `jax.numpy.linalg.solve` for calculating the inverse of the Fisher metric times a vector. However, using `jax.scipy.linalg.solve` can be even faster since we can benefit from the structure of the metric by setting `assume_a="pos"`.
2. In `benchmark_time.py`, the time for jit compilation was mistakenly taken into considerations when benchmarking the running times, and may lead to slightly inaccurate results. However, we ran some random experiments using the code without the time for jit compilation, and the general conclusion seems to remain unchanged.
